Gitarella born as a replacement for gitweb, as it wasn't providing something I
was looking for: direct URLs pointing to files in the repository.

The decision to make it a Ruby webapp was due to my passion for Ruby and the
availability of a lot of tools to write Web Applications, like CGI and FastCGI
libraries, and HTML template libraries and so on.

The current code, while not as evolved as gitweb's, can do basic browsing of the
repositories' tree and handle diff view of the changesets.

To be able to run gitarella you need:

- a webserver able to handle CGI or FastCGI requests (tested and developed using
lighttpd, but Apache should work just as fine);
- Ruby version 1.8;
- for FastCGI support, ruby-fcgi extension
  ( http://raa.ruby-lang.org/list.rhtml?name=fcgi );
- for memcached backend, Ruby-MemCache extension
  ( http://www.deveiate.org/projects/RMemCache/ );
- diff-lcs extensions, mandatory for diff viewing
  ( http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/diff-lcs ); TODO, make this optional;
